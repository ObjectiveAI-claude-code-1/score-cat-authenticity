    "spec": "Rank the provided cat photos by how authentically they capture genuine, unguarded moments where the cat is being itself naturally rather than posed or arranged for the camera. Evaluate the cat's body language, facial expressions, and behaviors to determine whether the moment appears candid and natural. Photos showing the cat in relaxed, comfortable states engaged in real activities should rank significantly higher than photos where the cat appears awkwardly positioned, forced into poses, or showing signs of being arranged for the camera.",
