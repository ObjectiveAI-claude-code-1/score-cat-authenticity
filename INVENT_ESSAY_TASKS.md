1. **Assess Authenticity and Natural Moments** - Evaluate whether the photograph captures a genuine, unguarded moment where the cat is being itself naturally, rather than posed or arranged for the camera. This task involves recognizing relaxed body language, natural expressions, and behaviors that reflect the cat's true state rather than a constructed scenario. The function should distinguish between candid moments of play, rest, curiosity, or affection and awkward poses that suggest the cat was positioned for the photograph.

2. **Evaluate Emotional Connection and Resonance** - Determine whether the photograph creates a genuine emotional bridge between the viewer and the cat. This task requires assessing whether the image evokes recognizable human feelings—whether we see vulnerability, playfulness, contentment, curiosity, or affection that creates empathy and understanding. The function should recognize images that move the viewer emotionally because they reveal something true about the cat's inner life and our shared experience with cats.

3. **Recognize Individual Personality and Character** - Identify and evaluate how well the photograph reveals the specific, unique personality of the individual cat pictured. This task involves detecting distinctive traits, habits, preferences, and behavioral quirks that make this particular cat distinct from all others. The function should recognize images that make us feel we truly know the cat—its sense of humor, its nature, its specific way of being in the world—rather than generic cat behavior.
