Rank cat photos by charm and authenticity. Determine which photos most effectively display genuine personality, emotional resonance, and natural, unforced moments that reveal the cat's true character. Evaluate whether each photo captures authentic feline behavior and creates a connection with the viewer, or whether it feels staged and artificial. Photos showing real moments of affection, playfulness, curiosity, or characteristic behavior should rank higher than those with awkward or posed expressions.
